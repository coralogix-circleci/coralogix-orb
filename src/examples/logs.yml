  This example shows how you can debug a workflow job in Coralogix.
  By adding our Orb and the coralogix/logs job at the end of the flow,
  you'll receive all logs CircleCI generates during the workflow in
  your Coralogix account, helping you debug the different jobs.
  Note that this may generate a large amount of data, and is recommended
  for debugging purposes only.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    coralogix: coralogix/coralogix@x.y.z
