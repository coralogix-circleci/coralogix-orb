  This example shows how you can send the
  final report of a workflow job to Coralogix.
  By adding our Orb and the coralogix/stats job at the end of the flow,
  you'll receive the report automatically in your Coralogix account and
  can analyze and aggregate the results.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    coralogix: coralogix/coralogix@x.y.z
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:stable
      steps:
        - run: echo "Typical build job"
  workflows:
    your-workflow:
      jobs:
        - build
        - coralogix/stats
