  This example shows how you can send additional 3rd party logs
  generated during your workflow job to Coralogix.
  By adding our Orb and the coralogix/send step, you can send 
  additional logs from an external file to your Coralogix account.
  This is especially useful if one of the stages of your job generates
   an external file with logs which you'd like to report to Coralogix 
   and analyze along with the rest of your logs.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    coralogix: coralogix/coralogix@x.y.z
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:stable
      steps:
        - run: echo "Build the application" > build.log
        - coralogix/send:
            file: build.log
  workflows:
    your-workflow:
      jobs:
        - build
